Hello world!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer in [Huawei ADS](https://auto.huawei.com/cn/), Shanghai, China. Our team is focused on sensor fusion and localization for autonomous driving system (ADS).

In 2022, I graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong University and got my master's degree in Machinical Engineer. Under the guidance of Prof. [Xuesong Mei](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37544593200), my research focused on Machine Vision and optical 3D measurement.

Currently, I'm interested in all kinds of deep-learning related technologies, especially in autonomous driving, SLAM and 3D reconstruction. I hope that L4 autonomous driving comes true in the next decade.

<!-- # TODO
- add my two articles to publication page
- choose between projects and repositories to show my github repos(projects) -->
